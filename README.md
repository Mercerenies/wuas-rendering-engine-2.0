# The WUAS Rendering Engine 2.0

The new WUAS rendering engine. This program is capable of taking input
as a WUAS datafile and producing output in any of the following
formats:
* WUAS datafile
* JSON
* Image (to screen or to a file)

The original rendering engine can be found [at
`wuas-render`](https://github.com/Mercerenies/wuas-render). The 2.0
engine is backward-compatible with that one.

For details on the input file format, see [`datafile_format.md`](datafile_format.md)
